# Binary repository

A repository of binaries from other build systems that is designed to be used with [bento](https://github.com/godalming123/bento).

# Issues

- For package-specific issues look for `toml` files in the `./sources` directory that specify `installationWarnings` and/or `knownIssues`
- There is some auto-generated stuff that is incorrect or poorly formatted:
  - Some of the checksums might use "x86_64" when they should use "amd64"
  - The source licenses info is badly formatted, and possibly incorrect
- Most sources are lacking certain metadata:
  - No descriptions
  - No licenses info

# Missing packages

- Firefox
