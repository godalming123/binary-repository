# Binary repository

A repository of binaries from other build systems that is designed to be used with [bento](https://github.com/godalming123/bento).

# Issues

- Btop cannot find it's themes
- Podman does not work (see [sources/podman.toml](https://github.com/godalming123/binary-repository/blob/main/sources/podman.toml))
- Act uses docker by default, but docker has not been packaged. The plan is to setup act to use podman by default once podman works because podman does not require root priviladges unlike docker.
