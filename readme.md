# Binary repository

A repository of binaries from other build systems that is designed to be used with [bento](https://github.com/godalming123/bento).

# Issues

- Btop cannot find it's themes
- Podman does not work (see [sources/podman.toml](https://github.com/godalming123/binary-repository/blob/main/sources/podman.toml))
- Act uses docker by default, but docker has not been packaged. The plan is to setup act to use podman by default once podman works because podman does not require root priviladges unlike docker.
- The close button on ghostty is incorrectly rendered when you hover over it
- Some of the checksums use "x86_64" when they should use "amd64" because the checksums were generated by a script

# Missing packages

- Go
- Fish
- Odin
- Zen browser

# Stargazers over time
