# Binary repository

A repository of binaries from other build systems that is designed to be used with [bento](https://github.com/godalming123/bento).

# Issues

- Btop cannot find it's themes
- Fish cannot find it's asset files (see [this issue](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11765))
- Podman does not work and there is no binary for podman in `./bin`
  - This is because podman has no option to load default configuration files (https://docs.podman.io/en/stable/markdown/podman.1.html#configuration-files) from a directory other then `/usr/share/containers` while still allowing the user to override some of the configuration files with files in `$HOME/.config/containers`. Apparently config parsing will be consolidated in podman 6, so hopefully this option can be added then.
- Act uses docker by default, but docker has not been packaged. The plan is to setup act to use podman by default once podman works because podman does not require root priviladges unlike docker.
- Some of the checksums might use "x86_64" when they should use "amd64" because the checksums were generated by a script
- Some binaries can ask to install packages from bento twice:
  - `npm`
  - `npx`
  - `odin`
- Add descriptions for sources
- Add licenses info for sources
- Zed tries to auto update itself
- `npx` does not seem to recognise binaries installed with `npm install -g`
- Lilipod only supports AMD64, but bento has no way of knowing this
- Cursor only works on x86_64, and bento has no way of knowing this
- Ghostty:
  - Only works on x86_64, and bento has no way of knowing this
  - Only works with glibc 2.41, but not 2.42 for some reason
  - The close button is incorrectly rendered when you hover over it
- `ols` only works when `odin` is downloaded since `ols` executes `odin root` to try and find where odin's standard library is
